FTSC Scheme was evaluated by the National Productivity Council in 2021 and the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) in 2023. As per their recommendations, to enhance the overall effectiveness of the FTSCs the following issues need to be addressed properly by the State/UT Governments and their respective High Courts for effecting justice for the victims of sexual abuse:
a. Strengthening of the investigation agencies, Forensic Science Laboratories, and Victim Compensation Schemes.
b. Ensuring timely submissions of DNA reports, deputing the appropriate number of Public Prosecutors, appropriate number of Vulnerable Witness Deposition Centres (VWDCs) and ensuring child-friendly response for deposition of testimonies of the witnesses.
c. Timely furnishing of data by the FTSCs on the online portal of the Department of Justice.
DISCLAIMER:Setting up and functioning of the FTSCs, Family Courts, Special Courts for MP/MLA and Fast Track Courts falls within the domain of State Govt. in consultation with their respective High Courts which are set up as per their need and resources.
