An array of legislative and policy reforms have been launched to strengthen the “Enforcing Contracts” regime. For speedy resolution of commercial cases the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 was passed and again amended in 2018. This has led to establishment of “Dedicated Commercial Courts” for the first time in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru with dedicated infrastructure and exclusive judicial human power. The specified value of commercial cases has been brought down to Rs 3 lakhs from Rs. 1 crore to bring in more commercial cases.
