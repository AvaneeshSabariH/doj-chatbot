The Tele-Law scheme, initiated by the Department of Justice, aims to address cases at the pre-litigation stage. Its main purpose is to connect citizens, especially the marginalized and disadvantaged in rural and remote areas, with Panel Lawyers for timely and valuable legal advice. This is done for free through video conferencing facilities available at Common Service Centres (CSCs) located at the panchayat level. This service ensures that people get access to justice without having to spend significant time or money on travel.
