As India approaches its 75th Republic Day, the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law & Justice has launched a significant initiative “ Samvidhan Katta ”, a celebration of Indian constitution through Dialogue and Awareness under the banner of “ Hamara Samvidhan, Hamara Samman .” This campaign, rooted in the very essence of our constitutional values, seeks to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Indian Constitution among citizens. “ Samvidhan Katta ,” is designed to encourage dialogue and discussion about the Constitution, its principles, and its impact on the lives of the people of India. Significance “ Samvidhan Katta ” is a unique platform where individuals from all walks of life—students, scholars, legal professionals, and common citizens—come together to engage in meaningful conversations about the Constitution. The term “Katta,” as used by Hon’ble Chief Justice of India- Dr. D.Y Chandrachud in the 2nd regional event held at Bikaner, Rajasthan. It is often associated with informal gatherings in Marathi language. It represents a space for open dialogue, where ideas and opinions can be freely exchanged. The objective of these sessions is to demystify the Constitution, making it accessible to everyone, and to highlight its role as a living document that protects the rights and liberties of all citizens. The Indian Constitution is not just a legal document; it is a charter of liberty and justice, enshrining the values of equality, dignity, and non-discrimination. The Department of Justice (DoJ) by this flagship event aims to push forward for the creation of Samvidhan Katta groups by providing resources, guides, and discussion materials. Whether it’s a small group of friends, a classroom, or a community center, any space can become a Samvidhan Katta. Join the movement , initiate your own Samvidhan Katta , share your stories, and contribut e to embedding constitutional values deeply into our society’s fabric Cases which can be included as stories Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992): Commonly known as the Mandal Commission case, this landmark judgment upheld the reservation policy for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government jobs. The Supreme Court recognized that affirmative action is essential to address historical injustices faced by marginalized communities and to ensure their participation in public life, thereby reinforcing the constitutional mandate of equality. Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997): This case was a watershed moment in addressing gender discrimination and harassment in the workplace. The Supreme Court laid down guidelines, known as the Vishaka Guidelines, to prevent sexual harassment at the workplace, thereby protecting the dignity and safety of women. These guidelines were eventually codified into the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013. Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018): This landmark judgment decriminalized consensual same-sex relations, striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutional right to equality, dignity, and privacy, thereby providing a significant victory for the LGBTQ+ community and challenging societal norms of discrimination. Indian Young Lawyers Association v. State of Kerala (2018): In this case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala Temple, striking down a centuries-old custom that barred women of menstruating age from entering the temple. The judgment was a significant step towards gender equality and non-discrimination based on gender and biological factors.
