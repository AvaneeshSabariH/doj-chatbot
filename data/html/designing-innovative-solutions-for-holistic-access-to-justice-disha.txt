It widens the outreach of its Tele-Law, Pro Bono Legal Services (Nyaya Bandhu) and Legal Literacy and Legal Awareness programmes both qualitatively and quantitatively. It further aims to create awareness and dissemination through use of technology and developing simplified Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material for the masses.

Nyaya Bandhu (Pro Bono Legal Services) Nyaya Bandhu (Pro Bono Legal Services) aims to create a pan India framework for dispensation of pro bono legal services. Under it Advocates interested to volunteer their time and services register on the Nyaya Bandhu Mobile App (available in Android/iOS/UMANG platform)and provide legal assistance to the persons eligible to avail free legal aid under Section 12 of Legal Services Authorities (LSA) Act, 1987 and registered on the Nyaya Bandhu App. Legal Literacy and Legal Awareness Pan India Legal Literacy and Legal Awareness aims to enable the vulnerable sections of society to have access to information about their legal rights, entitlements and creating better legal awareness so as to make justice delivery system citizen-centric Website Policies Hyperlinking Policy Copyright Policy Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Feedback Contact Us Help FAQ WIM Visitor Summary Content Owned by DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, Ministry of Law and Justice, GOI Developed and hosted by National Informatics Centre , Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology , Government of India Last Updated: Aug 11, 2025 Certified Quality Website
