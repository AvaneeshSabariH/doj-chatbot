About Programme:
The Panch Pran Pledge is a solemn commitment inspired by the vision articulated by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India from the Red Fort. It encapsulates the aspirations for a developed India, the eradication of a servile mentality, pride in our traditions, dedication to unity and integrity, and the awakening of a sense of duty in every citizen.
Timeline:Entire Year (January 2024 – January 2025)
Participants:All Citizens
Methodology:All Citizens can visit the activity page in MyGov Platform and recite the pledge to generate e-certificates. In addition, each VLE, spanning 2.5 Lakh Gram Panchayats, will recite the Panch Pran Pledge. They will then encourage a minimum of 200 citizens visiting the CSC to read the Pledge before availing any services. The Pledge will be available in digital format and may be posted within CSC premises. QR codes linking to the MyGov Platform campaign page will be displayed in CSCs and shared on social media and WhatsApp groups of CSC functionaries. Brochures and pamphlets will also be distributed.
Expected Outcome:The Panch Pran Pledge will permeate to the village level, raising awareness among citizens across 2.5 Lakh Gram Panchayats. It will serve as a medium to involve individuals in the nation-building process, rekindling the spirit of patriotism and fostering a sense of responsibility among citizens. Additionally, the Pledge will be translated into 22 Scheduled Languages through CSCs, ensuring broader accessibility and inclusivity.
