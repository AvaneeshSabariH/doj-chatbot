About
Samvidhan Katta : – A celebration of Indian constitution through Dialogue and Awareness. As India approaches its 75th Republic Day, the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law & Justice has launched a significant initiative “ Samvidhan Katta ”, a celebration of Indian constitution through Dialogue and Awareness under the banner of “ Hamara Samvidhan, Hamara Samman .” This campaign, rooted in the very essence of our constitutional values, seeks to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Indian Constitution among citizens. “ Samvidhan Katta ,” is designed to encourage dialogue and discussion about the Constitution, its principles, and its impact on the lives of the people of India.
Significance
“ Samvidhan Katta ” is a unique platform where individuals from all walks of life—students, scholars, legal professionals, and common citizens—come together to engage in meaningful conversations about the Constitution. The term “Katta,” as used by Hon’ble Chief Justice of India- Dr. D.Y Chandrachud in the 2nd regional event held at Bikaner, Rajasthan. It is often associated with informal gatherings in Marathi language. It represents a space for open dialogue, where ideas and opinions can be freely exchanged. The objective of these sessions is to demystify the Constitution, making it accessible to everyone, and to highlight its role as a living document that protects the rights and liberties of all citizens. The Indian Constitution is not just a legal document; it is a charter of liberty and justice, enshrining the values of equality, dignity, and non-discrimination.
The Department of Justice (DoJ) by this flagship event aims to push forward for the creation of Samvidhan Katta groups by providing resources, guides, and discussion materials. Whether it’s a small group of friends, a classroom, or a community center, any space can become a Samvidhan Katta.
