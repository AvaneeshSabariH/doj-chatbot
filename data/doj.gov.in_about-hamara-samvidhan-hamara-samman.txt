About Hamara Samvidhan Hamara Samman
To commemorate the momentous occasion of India’s 75th year as a Republic, the Department of Justice proudly inaugurates the pan-India year-long campaign, ‘Hamara Samvidhan Hamara Samman’. This initiative is more than just a commemoration; it’s a resounding call to action for every citizen to actively contribute to shaping the vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047.
At its core, the campaign serves as a dynamic platform aimed at empowering citizens with essential knowledge about their legal rights and responsibilities. By fostering a culture of legal compliance and reinforcing the rule of law, we aim to strengthen the fabric of our nation.
Participating in this campaign signifies a commitment to transcend individual interests and unite in the collective endeavor to build a nation founded on the principles of progress, inclusivity, and sustainable development.
Throughout the campaign, a plethora of activities and events will be organized both online and offline to raise awareness about rights, duties, and entitlements. These endeavors will be guided by three overarching sub-themes:
Sabko Nyay – Har Ghar Nyay: Ensuring justice for all, irrespective of socio-economic backgrounds.
Nav Bharat Nav Sankalp: Pledging for a new India, fueled by innovative ideas and renewed commitment.
Vidhi Jagriti Abhiyaan: Promoting legal literacy and awareness through grassroots initiatives and educational endeavors.
Together, let us embark on this transformative journey towards a brighter, more just future for our beloved nation.
